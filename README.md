### Hi there 

Hi, Iâ€™m Amelia ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ‘€ When I am not learning and analyzing, I enjoy swimming, traveling, exploring art, and trying new food.

- ðŸŒ± I am a recent graduate in Information Systems with a passion for data, analytics, and business intelligence. Coming from a background in economics/administrative studies and with experience in the hospitality industry, I bring a unique perspective to understanding and analyzing data. I pride myself on my ability to work with a variety of data sources and tools, and I'm always eager to learn new concepts and techniques in the field of data analytics and business intelligence. I'm dedicated to uncovering meaningful insights from raw data and excited to continue my journey in the world of data.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a research project called Good Buys, where we're developing a cutting-edge mobile application designed to empower consumers to make eco-conscious purchasing decisions effortlessly. Our application enables users to simply scan a product, accessing the associated ecolabels attributed to the company. By seamlessly integrating technology and sustainability, Good Buys not only enhances consumer awareness but also fosters a greener, more environmentally responsible shopping experience.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I've had the unique experience of living in both Lake Tahoe, where I braved the cold snowfall winters, and Palm Desert, CA, where I endured the scorching heat of 115-degree summers. These contrasting environments have added exciting chapters to my life story and have given me a deeper appreciation for the diversity of our world.

Looking forward to connecting and collaborating!
